# Project 1 – Python Data Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a clean, reproducible Python data analysis workflow using a real-world dataset.
The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and clear visual communication.

## Objectives
- Analyse a non-trivial, messy real-world dataset
- Clean and transform data using Python (pandas, numpy)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Produce clear, publication-quality visualisations
- Follow best practices in project structure and reproducibility

## Data
A public, real-world dataset will be used in this project.
Raw data will be stored in `data/raw/` and never modified directly.
All derived datasets will be written to `data/processed/`.

The data source will be fully documented once selected.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter

## Outputs
- Cleaned datasets
- Exploratory analysis notebooks
- Visualisations saved to `reports/figures/`

## Status
🚧 In progress — portfolio build
